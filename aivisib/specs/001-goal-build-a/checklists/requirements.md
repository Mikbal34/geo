# Specification Quality Checklist: Brand Analysis & Scoring Platform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASSED** - Specification avoids implementation details (no mention of specific Next.js patterns, Supabase schema details, or code structure)
✅ **PASSED** - Focuses on user value (marketing professionals analyzing brand positioning)
✅ **PASSED** - Written for business stakeholders (uses business language like "brand positioning", "competitive analysis")
✅ **PASSED** - All mandatory sections present (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria)

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASSED** - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present (all requirements are fully specified)
✅ **PASSED** - All 24 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous (each uses "MUST" and specific verbs)
✅ **PASSED** - Success criteria are measurable (specific time targets, percentages, and counts)
✅ **PASSED** - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focuses on user-facing outcomes, not implementation)
✅ **PASSED** - All acceptance scenarios defined in Given-When-Then format
✅ **PASSED** - 8 edge cases identified covering validation, error handling, and data integrity
✅ **PASSED** - Scope clearly bounded (single brand analysis, specific five dimensions, MVP focus)
✅ **PASSED** - Dependencies (LLM API, Supabase, chart library) and assumptions (English language, region format) documented

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASSED** - All 24 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
✅ **PASSED** - Three prioritized user scenarios cover complete workflow (P1: Setup, P2: Analysis, P3: Visualization)
✅ **PASSED** - 9 measurable success criteria define completion targets
✅ **PASSED** - No implementation leakage detected

## Summary

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items passed validation. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for the planning phase (`/speckit.plan`).

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive functional requirements (24 items covering all workflows)
- Well-structured user stories with independent testability
- Clear prioritization (P1-P3) enables incremental development
- Strong edge case coverage for robust implementation
- Technology-agnostic success criteria enable flexible implementation choices

**Next Steps**:
- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
- Or run `/speckit.clarify` if additional questions arise during review
