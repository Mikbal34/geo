# Implementation Plan: Brand Analysis & Scoring Platform

**Branch**: `001-goal-build-a` | **Date**: 2025-10-15 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-goal-build-a/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a web application that enables marketing professionals to analyze their brand's communication effectiveness across five dimensions (Relevance, Clarity, Consistency, Creativity, Emotional Impact). The system collects brand information, uses AI to generate and evaluate analysis prompts, compares against competitors, and delivers scored insights through visual dashboards. Technical approach uses Next.js 14 App Router for the frontend, Supabase for data persistence, and LLM APIs (OpenAI/Claude) for intelligent prompt generation and brand evaluation.

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
